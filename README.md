# Docker/Containers/Kubernetes/Rancher/Tanzu
This is a journey for me, I've been playing with containers for a little bit now, and I'm starting to really enjoy them.  This is a growing project, still very much in its infency.

I started with Docker, as I would say most would, Containers in general are going through an evelution with engines, CLI tools, etc.  The evelution was to K8's. However, its far more complicated.  You really want to use a Rancher or Tanzu to manage the K8's sea of containers.  So far, I am using Rancher simly due to cost.  I am a VMware person, so that is why I natually gravitated to Tanzu, but its still figuring itself out.

# Containers I Use:

## Open Speed Test
This is a really simple speed test solution for my internal home network, using HTML5 (Finally!).  I use this to test client connectivitiy with my cell phones/tablets/laptops when I am accused of the network being down. This is a self-hosted solution, which is now getting line-rate on the container all the way to my gateway (hard-wire), which I then use for interal testing to validate my network is solid.

## PiHole
This is one of my favorite projects, local DNS filtering. I started on a Raspberry Pi 2B, which grew up as my client list grew in my house.  I can block all sorts of junk DNS queries from my various smart devices, while not blocking the functions.  I am a supporter of this project, I highly recommend you check it out!

## Home Assistant
I am building my repo for Home Assistant, and I am just getting my feet wet with getting HA from my RasperryPi 4 to a container.  It works, just starting to play with it.
