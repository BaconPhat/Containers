# Docker
This is a journey for me, I've been playing with containers for a little bit now, and I'm starting to really enjoy them.  This is a growing project, still very much in its infency.  Stay tuned!

# Containers I Use:

## Open Speed Test
This is a really simple speed test solution for my internal home network, using HTML5 (Finally!).  I use this to test client connectivitiy with my cell phones/tablets/laptops when I am accused of the network being down. This is a self-hosted solution, which is now getting line-rate on the container all the way to my gateway (hard-wire), which I then use for interal testing to validate my network is solid.

## PiHole
This is one of my favorite projects, I started on a Raspberry Pi 2B, which grew up as my client list grew in my house.  I can block all sorts of junk DNS queries from my various smart devices, while not blocking the functions.  I am a supporter of this project, I highly recommend you check it out!
