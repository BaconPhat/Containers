# Docker/Podman/Containers/Kubernetes/OpenShift
This is a journey for me, I've been playing with containers for a little bit now, and I'm starting to really enjoy them.  This is a growing project.

I started with Docker, as I would say most would, Containers in general are going through an evelution with engines, CLI tools, etc. I'm started my journey with VMware Tanzu, then onto SUSE Rancher, now in the realm of Red Hat OpenShift.  So far, massive learning curves with each but I am having fun again!

## k8-class
This me learning high-level stuff, should be ever changing.

## ocp-local
I am using OCP local on my system, also should be ever changing

# Containers I Use:

## Open Speed Test
This is a really simple speed test solution for my internal home network, using HTML5 (Finally!).  I use this to test client connectivitiy with my cell phones/tablets/laptops when I am accused of the network being down. This is a self-hosted solution, which is now getting line-rate on the container all the way to my gateway (hard-wire), which I then use for interal testing to validate my network is solid.

## PiHole
This is one of my favorite projects, local DNS filtering. I started on a Raspberry Pi 2B, which grew up as my client list grew in my house.  I can block all sorts of junk DNS queries from my various smart devices, while not blocking the functions.  I am a supporter of this project, I highly recommend you check it out!

## Jellyfin
I've been an avid Plex fan for several years now, but I finally hit the end with it. I need a focus on my media without trying to be yet another streaming service.  I want my media to be played locally in my home without authenticating against Plex.tv, so I am trying Jellyfin for now.  I see a great falue in Jellyfin as a container, easy deployment and has integration with Home Assistant.

## Apache
I am frustraited enough with my current service provider, I am hosting a site locally to have far better control over uptime and backups/restores if needed.
